## On the Hill

On campus, I stay busy as a member of the Women's Cross Country and Track and Field teams, and as the Student-Alumni Liaison in Student Government Association. 

Running takes up a lot of my time as we compete all year and practice six days a week. Being on the XC team has been a highlight of my college experience, and I'm so grateful to get to run and compete with such a cool group of gals! 

In SGA, I am currently serving my second term as the Student-Alumni Liaison. Through my role, I meet regularly with the Alumni and Parent Relations Office, attend weekly Student Senate meetings, serve as the student representative on the Alumni and Family Board. 
Last year, I have had the privilege to attend alumni events on campus, in Minneapolis, and in Washington DC! If you have any ideas on how to get students and alumni connected, please let me know!
Additionally, I was a part of the Student Affairs Committee project titled ["Pressure and Success: A Collection of Student Perspectives."](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGkkd0OGTo/PWSzMa-1kIboPnUg-PxRSg/view?utm_content=DAGkkd0OGTo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h64222222f9#1) The project was presented to the St. Olaf Board of Regents and shared with the Piper Center for Vocation and Career, challenging the college to think critically about their messaging and student support regarding success.

Finally, I stay active in the Economics Department by working as a Teaching Assistant. I have been a TA for both Macroeconomic Theory and Microeconomic Theory, and enjoy getting to develop relationships with my professors!

## Off the Hill

Beyond school, my family is my largest priority. I love seeing my parents whenever I can, and I visit my sister, Bergen, in DC as often as possible. As a family, we love to travel together, play pickle ball, hit the golf course, and go on bike rides. Bergen and I love to run together and we ran our first half-marathon together this past summer in LA.
